# The library to use when communicating with the GPIO pins.
# Defaults to attempting to load RPi.GPIO, then RPIO, then pigpio, and
# finally uses a native Python implementation.
# Valid values include “rpigpio”, “rpio”, “pigpio”, “native”, and “mock”.
# The latter is most useful on non-Pi platforms as it emulates
# a Raspberry Pi model 3B (by default).
